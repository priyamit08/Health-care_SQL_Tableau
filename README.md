# Health-care_SQL_Tableau

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing patient rehabilitation data using SQL and a data visualization tool, preferably Tableau. The primary goal is to clean, explore, and visualize the data to derive meaningful insights. The dataset comprises clinic group data, patient/clinic data, and module completion data.

## Tools used
SQL - PostgreSQL
Data Visualization Tool - Tableau

## Data Files
assignment_data_clinic_group.csv: Contains clinic group data (clinic IDs and Clinic Groups)
assignment_data_clinics_with_patients.csv: Contains patient/clinic data (patient IDs, clinic title, clinic IDs, patient created at date, and patient deleted at date)
assignment_data_modules.csv: Contains module data (patient IDs, date of module generation, number of modules)

## Objectives
Import the Data: Create a SQL database and import the provided CSV files.
Create a Dataset: Combine data from imported tables into a single final table with the following columns:
patient ID
clinic ID
clinic title
clinic group
patient created at date
module completion date
number of modules


## Explore the Dataset: Performed exploratory data analysis


## Visualize the Data for the following insights
1. Number of patient accounts created per month
2. Number of modules generated per month with filtering per clinic title, year, and clinic group. Include a filter to switch between week/month/quarter if possible.
3. Clinic Performance Assessment:Assessing the performance of clinics based on module completion, where 24 modules indicate successful therapy completion.
